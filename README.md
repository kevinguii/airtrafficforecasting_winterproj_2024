# Air Traffic Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting air traffic using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to analyze historical air traffic data and build models that can accurately predict future air traffic patterns. This project leverages various data preprocessing methods, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictions on future air traffic
- Visualization of results

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebook (`ML_Dave_airtraffic_project.ipynb` or `dave_airtraffic_project.ipynb`) to explore the data analysis, preprocessing steps, and model training.
- Use `main.py` to run the forecasting models and generate predictions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is provided in `airtraffic.csv` and `before_encoding.csv`. These files contain historical air traffic data that is used for training and evaluating the models.

## Models

The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms to forecast air traffic, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Results

The results of the models are visualized in the Jupyter notebooks, providing insights into the accuracy and performance of each model.
